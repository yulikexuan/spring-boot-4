     * The Java compiler doesn't look at the specific values inside
     * Box (the "Study Guide" or "Pencil") to determine dominance;
     * On the other hand, it only looks at the Types and the Guards.
     *
     * The compiler follows a very simple rule for dominance:
     *   If a case has a when `guard`, the compiler assumes that the guard
     *   might be false.
     * Even if you know that x.name() will never be null for your specific
     * variable b, the compiler sees `when x.name() != null` and thinks:
     *   Aha! There is a mathematical possibility that x.name() could be null
     *   If that happens, I need the cases below it to handle the fallout.
     *
     * A guarded case dominates another if the pattern is the same (or more general)
     * and the compiler can see that the logic overlaps completely.
     * However, the most common scenario for dominance with guards is when you
     * have an unguarded version of the same pattern below it.
     *
     * !!! The compiler is smart, but it doesn't execute your code.
     * It won't try to solve complex math in your when clause to see
     * if two guards overlap perfectly.
     * It mostly cares about the Type of the pattern and whether a Guard is present.
     * If a guard is present, Java assumes it might evaluate to false,
     * allowing the next case a chance to run.
